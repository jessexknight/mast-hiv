\section{Simulation Model Overview}\label{mod.ov}
The simulation model is a discrete-time, stochastic individual-based model
representing an open population
of approximately $N$ sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals aged
\note{10--59}
     {From some reading, it seems school is a major context where SGM violence occurs,
      and this can start before SGM are "out",
      so I changed the minimum age for modelling events to 10 from 15.}
including men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) in
\note{an illustrative Sub-Saharan African context.}{To discuss eventually ...}
The model aims to represent the sexual life-course events of SGM with respect to
the potential causal pathways in Figure~\ref{fig:dag},
with the approximate representation shown in Figure~\ref{fig:model}:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*)]
  \item exposure to SGM violence
  \item distal mediators, including:
        depression and hazardous drinking
  \item proximal determinants of HIV risk, including:
        sexual partnership dynamics and condom use
\end{enumerate}
SGM violence is conceptualized as
\note{any verbal and/or physical violence}
     {I know we may want to split up verbal and physical violence later,
      but leaving as combined for now ...}
on the basis of an individuals' gender and/or sexual identity.
\par
Individuals enter the model in a ``null state'', reflecting
no prior SGM violence, depression, \hazdrink, or sexual activity.
At each timestep, individuals in the model can then experience
any combination of the following events:
exposure to SGM violence,
depression onset or recovery,
hazardous drinking onset or recovery,
non-heterosexual partnership formation or dissolution,
and sex within modelled partnerships (including whether a condom is used).
Rates of ``downstream'' events are influenced by
the current and possibly past states of individuals' ``upstream'' variables,
as described below in \sref{mod.par.evt}.

\paragraph{Implementation}
The model uses a fixed timestep of $\dt = 7$ days,%
\footnote{One year is thus defined as $52\dt$.}
reflecting a trade-off between temporal resolution and computational efficiency.
Event-scheduling approaches were considered infeasible because
multiple ``upstream'' events are modelled to have
immediate effects on the rates of ``downstream'' events
(\eg exposure to SGM violence
immediately increases the rate of depression onset);
thus, ``downstream'' events cannot be scheduled.
Instead, each timestep, the probability of each event occurring
is computed for all individuals aged 10--59, using vectorized code.
The model is implemented in R (v3.6.3), with code available online.%
